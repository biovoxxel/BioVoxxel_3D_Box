## Functionalities
- Threshold Check: A helping tool to better identify suitable histogram-based automatic intensity thresholds, compare them qualitatively and quantitatively. This is based on the publication: [Qualitative and Quantitative Evaluation of Two New Histogram Limiting Binarization Algorithms](https://www.cscjournals.org/library/manuscriptinfo.php?mc=IJIP-829), IJIP (2014).



## Installation
The Biovoxxel Toolbox as well as the BioVoxxel 3D Box are distributed via the [BioVoxxel Fiji update site](https://imagej.net/update-sites/following)

## Acknowledgement
The BioVoxxel 3D Box funtions are heavily based and rely strongly on the CLIJ library family.
Therefore, this development would have not been possible without the work of Robert Haase and colleagues.
